run particular test
mvn test -Dtest=CarTest2

By default Maven uses the following naming conventions when looking for tests to run:

Test*
*Test
*Tests (has been added in Maven Surefire Plugin 2.20)
*TestCase
If your test class doesn't follow these conventions you should rename it or configure Maven Surefire Plugin to use another pattern for test classes.
