# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

This is a complete guide to Interview Preparation. This repository entails some of the most frequently asked Data Structures and Algorithms. It contains the theory as well as popular problems from LeetCode and Cracking the Coding Interview Book. 

This may also help, if you're a computer science student who needs to prepare for exams -- or if you're a self-taught programmer who wants to brush up on the theory behind your craft -- this repository will definitely help!

# Algorithms

Different problems require the use of different kinds of techniques. A good programmer uses all these techniques based on the type of problem. Some commonly-used techniques are:

1. Divide and conquer
2. Randomized algorithms
3. Greedy algorithms
4. Dynamic programming
5. Recursion


### Sorting
1. Basic Sorts
    - [Insertion Sort]()
    - [Bubble Sort]()
    - [Selection Sort]()
2. Fast Sorts
    - [Merge Sort]()
    - [Quick Sort]()
    - [Hoare Quick Sort]()
    - [Heap Sort](sorting/heap_sort.md)
  
3. Special Purpose Sorts
    - [Counting Sort]()
    - [Radix Sort]()



### Searching

- [Linear Search](). Find an element in an array.
- [Binary Search](). Quickly find elements in a sorted array.
- [k-th Largest Element](). Find the k-th largest element in an array, such as the median.
- String Search
    - [Brute-Force String Search](). A naive method.
    - [Boyer-Moore](). A fast method to search for substrings. It skips ahead based on a look-up table, to avoid looking at every character in the text.


### Backtracking

- [Knights Tour]().
- [N Queens]().
- [Rat in a Maze]().
- [Subset Sum]().

# Useful Information

### Big O Notation

Big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their running time or space requirements grow as the input size grows. On the chart below you may find most common orders of growth of algorithms specified in Big O notation.

Below is the list of some of the most used Big O notations and their performance comparisons against different sizes of the input data.
