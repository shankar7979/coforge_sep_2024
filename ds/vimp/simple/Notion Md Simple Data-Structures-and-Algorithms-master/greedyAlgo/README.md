# Greedy Algorithm

## Introduction

- A greedy algorithm, as the name suggests, always makes the choice that seems to be the best at that moment. 
- This means that it makes a locally-optimal choice in the hope that this choice will lead to a globally-optimal solution.

#### How do you decide which choice is optimal?

- Assume that you have an objective function that needs to be optimized (either maximized or minimized) at a given point. 
- A Greedy algorithm makes greedy choices at each step to ensure that the objective function is optimized. 
- The Greedy algorithm has only one shot to compute the optimal solution so that it never goes back and reverses the decision.

###### Note: Most greedy algorithms are not correct.


## Standard Greedy Algorithms

Greedy Algorithms can be used to solve a variety of problems including graphs, NP Complete problems. But, here we are going to discuss some of the standard greedy algorithms.
