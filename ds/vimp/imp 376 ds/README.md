<h1 align="center">Data Structures and Algorithms</h1>

  <p align="center">
    Some basic implementations of important data structures and algorithms in Java, along with a few <strong>LeetCode</strong> questions. I'll keep on adding more solutions of LeetCode problems and if you want, you can add them too!
    <br />
    Also, I've started adding solutions to <strong><a href="https://algoexpert.io">AlgoExpert</a></strong> problems. You can find them in the Contents section.

<!-- BUILT WITH  -->

### Built With

- [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) - Since all the data structures and algorithms are implemented with Java, so there's nothing else to be setup except that.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Java 11 setup in your local machine before you can run any one of the programs. Check out the [official guide from Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html#GUID-8677A77F-231A-40F7-98B9-1FD0B48C346A) for that.

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/alpha037/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
