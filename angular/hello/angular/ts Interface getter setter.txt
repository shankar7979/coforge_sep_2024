Angular, getters and setters are commonly used to control access to component properties, especially when dealing with @Input properties from parent components. They provide a mechanism to intercept and react to changes in property values, allowing for validation, transformation, or other side effects.
1. Basic Implementation:
A getter retrieves the value of a private property, and a setter sets it. This is typically done by declaring a private variable (often prefixed with an underscore) to hold the actual value, and then defining public getter and setter methods that interact with this private variable. 
TypeScript

export class MyComponent {
  private _data: string;

  get data(): string {
    return this._data;
  }

  set data(value: string) {
    // Perform validation, transformation, or side effects here
    this._data = value.toUpperCase(); // Example: convert to uppercase
  }
}
2. With @Input Properties:
When used with @Input properties, getters and setters provide a way to react to changes in data passed from a parent component.
TypeScript

import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: `<h2>{{ formattedTitle }}</h2>`
})
export class ChildComponent {
  private _title: string;

  @Input()
  set title(value: string) {
    this._title = value.trim(); // Example: trim whitespace
  }

  get formattedTitle(): string {
    return `Title: ${this._title}`;
  }
}
In this example, when the title input property is set by the parent component, the set title() method is invoked, allowing for data manipulation (like trimming whitespace). The formattedTitle getter then provides a derived value for display in the template.
Advantages of using Getters and Setters in Angular:
Data Validation and Transformation:
Setters allow you to enforce rules or modify incoming data before it's stored.
Encapsulation:
They hide the internal implementation details of how a property is stored and accessed.
Computed Properties:
Getters can create properties whose values are derived from other data, without needing to store them explicitly.
Reacting to Input Changes:
For @Input properties, setters provide a clean way to execute logic when the input value changes, similar to ngOnChanges but often more focused and encapsulated.

interface MyDataItem {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

// Define the class that will hold the array of objects
class MyClass {
  public dataItems: MyDataItem[]; // Declare a public property to store the array

  constructor(initialData: MyDataItem[]) { // The constructor takes an array of MyDataItem
    this.dataItems = []; // Initialize the array
    if (initialData && initialData.length > 0) {
      // Iterate through the input array and push each item to the class's property
      initialData.forEach(item => {
        this.dataItems.push(item);
      });
    }
  }
}

// Example usage:
const inputData: MyDataItem[] = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Item A' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Item B' }
];

const myInstance = new MyClass(inputData);

console.log(myInstance.dataItems);
// Output: [{ id: 1, name: 'Item A' }, { id: 2, name: 'Item B' }]
Explanation:
Interface Definition:
An interface (MyDataItem in this example) is used to define the structure of the objects within your array, providing type safety.
Class Property:
The MyClass defines a public property dataItems which is declared as an array of MyDataItem objects.
Constructor with Array Argument:
The constructor of MyClass accepts a single argument, initialData, which is expected to be an array of MyDataItem.
Initialization and Iteration:
Inside the constructor, this.dataItems is initialized as an empty array. Then, it checks if initialData is provided and not empty. If so, it iterates through initialData using forEach and pushes each item into this.dataItems.
This approach ensures that the array property within your class is properly initialized and populated with the data provided during the object's creation.


 also try this solution

ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("classpath*:app-context.xml");
in this the spring automatically finds the class in the class path itself

It also seems to work for Spring Boot with @ImportResource("classpath*:config.xml") â€“

Try this:

ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("app-context.xml");
