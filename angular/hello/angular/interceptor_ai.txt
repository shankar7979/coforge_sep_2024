Angular 17 provides two primary ways to implement HTTP interceptors: functional interceptors and class-based (DI-based) interceptors. Both allow you to inspect and transform HTTP requests and responses, but they differ in their structure and how they leverage Angular's Dependency Injection (DI) system.
1. Functional Interceptors:
Structure:
Functional interceptors are plain JavaScript functions that implement the HttpInterceptorFn interface. They receive the HttpRequest and HttpHandlerFn as arguments.
Dependency Injection:
They can leverage Angular's inject() function within their body to obtain dependencies (e.g., services, configuration values). This allows them to access other parts of your application without being a class themselves.
Registration:
Functional interceptors are registered within the provideHttpClient() function, typically in app.config.ts for standalone applications, using withInterceptors([]).
Example:
TypeScript

import { HttpInterceptorFn } from '@angular/common/http';
import { inject } from '@angular/core';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service'; // Example service

export const authInterceptor: HttpInterceptorFn = (req, next) => {
  const authService = inject(AuthService);
  const authToken = authService.getToken(); // Get token from service

  if (authToken) {
    const clonedReq = req.clone({
      headers: req.headers.set('Authorization', `Bearer ${authToken}`)
    });
    return next(clonedReq);
  }
  return next(req);
};
2. Class-Based (DI-Based) Interceptors:
Structure:
These are injectable classes that implement the HttpInterceptor interface. They have an intercept method that receives the HttpRequest and HttpHandler as arguments.
Dependency Injection:
Dependencies are injected through the class constructor, similar to other Angular services.
Registration:
Class-based interceptors are registered as multi-providers in the providers array of your module or app.config.ts (for standalone) using provideHttpClient(withInterceptorsFromDi()) and HTTP_INTERCEPTORS.
Example:
TypeScript

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpInterceptor, HttpRequest, HttpHandler, HttpEvent, HTTP_INTERCEPTORS } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service'; // Example service

@Injectable()
export class AuthClassInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {
  constructor(private authService: AuthService) {}

  intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {
    const authToken = this.authService.getToken();

    if (authToken) {
      const clonedReq = req.clone({
        headers: req.headers.set('Authorization', `Bearer ${authToken}`)
      });
      return next.handle(clonedReq);
    }
    return next.handle(req);
  }
}

// In app.config.ts or your module's providers array:
// { provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: AuthClassInterceptor, multi: true }
Key Difference and Choice:
Functional interceptors are generally preferred in new Angular 17+ projects, especially with standalone components, due to their simpler, more concise syntax and direct use of inject(). Class-based interceptors remain compatible and are suitable for existing projects or scenarios where a class structure is preferred for organizational reasons. The choice largely depends on your project's architecture and personal preference.

======================

Angular Interceptors provide a mechanism to inspect and transform HTTP requests and responses globally before they are sent to the server or 
processed by the client. 
They act as a middleware layer, allowing developers to centralize common tasks related to HTTP communication. 

Purpose:
Interceptors are used to handle cross-cutting concerns related to HTTP requests and responses, such as:
Adding common headers (e.g., authorization tokens).
Logging requests and responses for debugging.
Centralized error handling.
Modifying request or response bodies.

Implementing caching mechanisms.
Displaying loading indicators during HTTP calls.
Implementation:
To create an interceptor, a service needs to implement the HttpInterceptor interface from @angular/common/http. This interface requires the implementation of an intercept() method. 
TypeScript

    import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
    import {
      HttpInterceptor,
      HttpRequest,
      HttpHandler,
      HttpEvent
    } from '@angular/common/http';
    import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

    @Injectable()
    export class MyInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {
      intercept(
        req: HttpRequest<any>,
        next: HttpHandler
      ): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {
        // Modify the request here, e.g., add a header
        const modifiedReq = req.clone({
          setHeaders: { 'X-Custom-Header': 'Value' }
        });

        // Pass the modified request to the next handler in the chain
        return next.handle(modifiedReq);
      }
    }
Registration: Interceptors are registered in the providers array of an Angular module (typically AppModule) using the HTTP_INTERCEPTORS token.
TypeScript

    import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
    import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
    import { HttpClientModule, HTTP_INTERCEPTORS } from '@angular/common/http';
    import { MyInterceptor } from './my.interceptor'; // Import your interceptor

    @NgModule({
      declarations: [
        // ...
      ],
      imports: [BrowserModule, HttpClientModule],
      providers: [
        {
          provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,
          useClass: MyInterceptor,
          multi: true // Essential for allowing multiple interceptors
        }
      ],
      bootstrap: [AppComponent]
    })
    export class AppModule {}

Interceptor Chain: Multiple interceptors can be registered, forming an interceptor chain. 
Requests flow through the chain in the order they are provided, and responses flow back in the reverse order. 
The last interceptor in the chain is always the HttpBackend, which handles communication with the server.
