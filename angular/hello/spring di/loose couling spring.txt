spring" example of loose coupling involves a component that depends on a Shape interface rather than a concrete Square or Circle class, allowing different shapes to be injected at runtime via Spring's Dependency Injection (DI), making the code flexible and testable, as shown in  example using a ShapeCreatorService that depends on a PrintShape interface.
 
How it works (Spring DI)
Interface Definition: Create an interface for the abstract behavior (e.g., Shape).
Java

    public interface Shape {
        void draw();
    }
Concrete Implementations: Create classes that implement the interface (e.g., Square, Circle).
Java

    @Component
    public class Square implements Shape {
        @Override
        public void draw() {
            System.out.println("Drawing a Square.");
        }
    }
Dependent Component: Create a class that needs a Shape but depends on the interface (e.g., a ShapePrinter or ShapeCreatorService).
Java

    @Component
    public class ShapeCreatorService {
        private Shape shape;

        // Setter injection for dependency
        @Autowired
        public void setShape(Shape shape) {
            this.shape = shape;
        }

        public void printShape() {
            shape.draw();
        }
    }
Spring Configuration: Use Spring's DI to inject a concrete Shape implementation (like Square) into the ShapeCreatorService at runtime. 
In older Spring XML configurations, you'd use a <property name="shape" ref="squareBean"/> tag to link the service to the specific shape bean. 
With modern Spring Boot and annotations, this is often handled automatically by @Autowired. 
Benefits
Flexibility:
You can change the shape (e.g., to a Circle) by simply changing the Spring configuration or annotations, without modifying the ShapeCreatorService code, as shown in this NareshIT example. 
Testability:
You can inject a "mock" shape for testing the ShapeCreatorService independently of a real shape implementation, as demonstrated in the Syntax Minds article. 
Example Code Snippets (Illustrative)
Java

// Interface
public interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

// Implementations
@Component
public class Square implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() { System.out.println("Drawing a Square."); }
}

@Component
public class Circle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() { System.out.println("Drawing a Circle."); }
}

// Service that depends on the interface
@Component
public class ShapePrinter {
    private Shape shape;

    // Constructor injection
    public ShapePrinter(@Autowired Shape shape) {
        this.shape = shape;
    }

    public void printCurrentShape() {
        shape.draw();
    }
}
In this setup, ShapePrinter doesn't know or care if it's a Square or a Circle â€“ it only knows it needs something that `draw()`s. This is the essence of loose coupling. 
This video explains the concept of loose coupling and dependency injection with a practical example:


============.

a loose-coupling Spring car example, the Car class depends on an Engine interface instead of a concrete PetrolEngine class, allowing the Spring IoC container to inject different Engine implementations (like DieselEngine) without modifying the Car class. This is achieved through Dependency Injection and the use of interfaces, promoting flexibility, testability, and easier maintenance by separating the Car's core logic from the specific engine details. 
Scenario: A Car Needs an Engine
Imagine a Car that needs an engine to drive, but you want to be able to swap engines (e.g., from petrol to electric) easily. 
1. Define the Contract (Interface)
Create an interface for the engine, defining a common method that all engines must implement. 
Java

public interface Engine {
    void start();
}
2. Create Concrete Engine Implementations
Create classes that implement the Engine interface. 
Java

// A petrol engine
@Service // Spring manages this bean
public class PetrolEngine implements Engine {
    @Override
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Petrol engine started");
    }
}

// An electric engine
@Service // Spring manages this bean
public class ElectricEngine implements Engine {
    @Override
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Electric engine started");
    }
}
3. The Car Class (Loosely Coupled)
The Car class depends on the Engine interface, not a specific implementation. It receives the Engine object through the constructor (constructor injection) or a setter method, facilitated by Spring's Dependency Injection. 
Java

@Component // Spring manages this bean
public class Car {
    private final Engine engine; // Depends on the interface

    // Spring injects the Engine dependency here
    @Autowired
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void drive() {
        engine.start(); // Calls the engine's start method
        System.out.println("Car is driving");
    }
}
4. Spring Configuration (Implicit with Annotations)
With annotations like @Service and @Component, Spring's IoC container (Inversion of Control container) automatically manages the creation of these objects (beans). It finds the Car and knows it needs an Engine, and based on its configuration or default behavior, it will inject an appropriate Engine implementation. 
How it Achieves Loose Coupling
Dependency on Interface:
The Car class doesn't know about PetrolEngine or ElectricEngine specifically. It only cares that it gets an Engine that can start(). 
Dependency Injection:
The Engine object is provided to the Car from an external source (the Spring container), rather than the Car creating it itself. 
Flexibility:
To change the car's engine from petrol to electric, you'd only need to change the Spring configuration to tell it to inject an ElectricEngine into the Car. No changes are needed in the Car class itself. 
This approach makes the system more flexible and maintainable, as components are not hardcoded to each other, making it easy to swap them out as needed. 

=============
Spring game example demonstrating loose coupling would involve a GameRunner (or console) class that depends on a GamingSoftware interface, not concrete game classes like SuperMario or SuperContra. This GameRunner takes a GamingSoftware object via its constructor (dependency injection) and the GamingSoftware interface defines the methods for game actions (e.g., up(), down()). The Spring framework, through its Inversion of Control (IoC) container and annotations like @Autowired, manages the creation and injection of specific GamingSoftware implementations, like SuperMario or SuperContra, into the GameRunner, allowing for interchangeable games without altering the GameRunner class. 
1. The Interface (GamingSoftware)
This interface defines the common actions all games must implement, ensuring a contract for any game. 
Java

public interface GamingSoftware {
    public void up();
    public void down();
    public void left();
    public void right();
}
2. Concrete Game Implementations
These are the actual game classes that implement the GamingSoftware interface. 

============game framework using the Spring Framework illustrates loose coupling by using interfaces and Dependency Injection (DI). A central GameRunner class can operate any game by depending on a GamingConsole interface, rather than a specific game implementation like MarioGame or PacmanGame. 
The problem: Tight coupling
In a tightly coupled system, the GameRunner would be hard-coded to a specific game, such as MarioGame. 
java
// Tightly coupled example
public class MarioGame {
    public void up() { System.out.println("Jump"); }
    public void down() { System.out.println("Go into a hole"); }
}

public class GameRunner {
    // GameRunner is explicitly dependent on MarioGame
    private MarioGame game; 

    public GameRunner(MarioGame game) {
        this.game = game;
    }

    public void run() {
        game.up();
        game.down();
    }
}
Use code with caution.

The issue: To switch to a different game, you would need to modify the GameRunner class's code and constructor. This is inflexible and difficult to maintain. 
The Spring solution: Loose coupling
Using Spring, we can introduce loose coupling by coding to an interface. This makes the GameRunner independent of the specific game implementation. 
1. Define the interface
First, define an interface for all games that need to be run. 
java
// 1. The interface that all games will implement
public interface GamingConsole {
    void up();
    void down();
}
Use code with caution.

2. Implement the interface
Next, create specific game classes that implement the GamingConsole interface. 
java
// 2. A specific game implementation
public class MarioGame implements GamingConsole {
    @Override
    public void up() {
        System.out.println("Mario: Jump");
    }

    @Override
    public void down() {
        System.out.println("Mario: Go into a hole");
    }
}

// 2. Another game implementation
public class PacmanGame implements GamingConsole {
    @Override
    public void up() {
        System.out.println("Pacman: Move up");
    }

    @Override
    public void down() {
        System.out.println("Pacman: Move down");
    }
}
Use code with caution.

3. Use Dependency Injection (DI)
The GameRunner class is refactored to depend on the GamingConsole interface, not a specific game. Spring's Inversion of Control (IoC) container will then inject the correct game implementation at runtime. 
java
// 3. The loosely coupled GameRunner
@Component
public class GameRunner {
    private final GamingConsole game; // Depends only on the interface

    // Spring injects the dependency through the constructor
    @Autowired
    public GameRunner(GamingConsole game) {
        this.game = game;
    }

    public void run() {
        game.up();
        game.down();
    }
}
Use code with caution.

4. Configure and run the application
You can now create an application class to configure and run the game. 
Without Spring (manual wiring):
You would manually create and pass the game object.
java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    GamingConsole mario = new MarioGame();
    GameRunner runner = new GameRunner(mario);
    runner.run(); // Runs MarioGame

    GamingConsole pacman = new PacmanGame();
    GameRunner runner2 = new GameRunner(pacman);
    runner2.run(); // Runs PacmanGame
}
Use code with caution.

With Spring (automatic wiring):
By using annotations, Spring's IoC container automatically manages and injects the dependency. You only need to tell Spring which implementation to use, typically with a @Bean or @Component annotation. 
java
@Configuration
@ComponentScan("com.example.game") // Scans for @Component classes
public class GameConfiguration {

    // You can also define which bean to use in the configuration
    @Bean
    public GamingConsole marioGame() {
        return new MarioGame();
    }
}

public class MainApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Start the Spring application context
        try (var context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(GameConfiguration.class)) {
            // Get the GameRunner bean from the context
            GameRunner runner = context.getBean(GameRunner.class);
            runner.run(); // Will run the MarioGame bean defined in the configuration
        }
    }
}
Use code with caution.

Key benefits

Flexibility and Maintainability: To switch from MarioGame to PacmanGame, you only need to change the configuration (e.g., changing which @Bean is active or altering which implementation Spring auto-discovers), not the GameRunner class itself.
Encapsulation: The GameRunner class is protected from internal changes to the MarioGame or PacmanGame classes, as long as they honor the GamingConsole interface.
Testability: You can easily swap in a mock or fake implementation of the GamingConsole for unit testing the GameRunner in isolation, without needing a full game implementation. 
AI responses may include mistakes.
