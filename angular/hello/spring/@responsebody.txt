HTTP PUT method.
•	 The @ResponseBody annotation is applied to all methods. This instructs that all the 
return values from the methods should be written to the HTTP response stream 
directly and not matched to a view.
•	 For methods that accept path variables (for example, the findSingerById()
method), the path variable is annotated with @PathVariable. This instructs 
Spring MVC to bind the path variable within the URL (for example, http://
localhost:8080/singer/1) into the id argument of the findSingerById() method. 
Note that for the id argument, the type is Long, while Spring’s type conversion 
system will automatically handle the conversion from String to Long for us.
•	 For the create() and update() method, the Singer argument is annotated with 
@RequestBody. This instructs Spring to automatically bind the content within the 
HTTP request body into the Singer domain object. The conversion will be done by 
the declared instances of the HttpMessageConverter<Object> interface (under the 
package org.springframework.http.converter) for supporting formats, which will 
be discussed later in this chapter.
 Starting with Spring 4.0, a controller annotation dedicated for REST usage was introduced, the 
@RestController. This is a convenience annotation that is itself annotated with @Controller and 
@ResponseBody. When used on a controller class, all methods that are annotated with @RequestMapping 
are automatically annotated with @ResponseBody. A version of the SingerController written using this 
annotation will be covered later in the chapter.
Configuring a Spring Web Application
A Spring web application is needed to resolve the REST requests sent by a client, so it needs to be configured. 
Earlier in the chapter we covered a simple web application configuration. That configuration now must be 
enriched with HTTP message converter beans for XML and JSON.
Spring web applications follow the Front Controller design pattern,4
 where all requests are received by 
a single controller, which later dispatches them to the appropriate handlers (controller classes). This
