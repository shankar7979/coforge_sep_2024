Spring, the terms "Web Client" (referring to WebClient) and "WebSocket" (referring to the underlying WebSocket protocol and Spring's WebSocketClient or STOMP over WebSocket support) represent distinct approaches to client-server communication with different use cases and characteristics.
WebClient:
Protocol: Primarily used for making HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to RESTful or other HTTP-based services.
Communication Model: Request-response. The client sends a request, and the server sends a response, after which the connection can be closed (though persistent connections are common for efficiency).
API: Reactive and non-blocking, built on Project Reactor. It's designed for efficient handling of asynchronous operations and streams of data.
Use Cases: Consuming REST APIs, fetching data from traditional web services, interacting with microservices, and general HTTP communication where a persistent, bidirectional connection is not required.
WebSocket:
Protocol: A distinct protocol that provides full-duplex, bidirectional communication over a single, persistent TCP connection.
Communication Model: Persistent, bidirectional. Once the connection is established via an HTTP handshake, both the client and server can send messages to each other at any time without initiating new requests.
API: In Spring, you might use WebSocketClient for low-level WebSocket interactions or leverage STOMP (Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol) over WebSocket for higher-level messaging patterns, often with WebSocketStompClient and SockJsClient.
Use Cases: Real-time applications like chat, live data updates (e.g., stock tickers, sports scores), multiplayer online games, notifications, and any scenario requiring low-latency, continuous communication between client and server.
Key Differences Summarized:
Feature
WebClient (HTTP)
WebSocket
Protocol
HTTP (request-response)
WebSocket (persistent, bidirectional)
Communication
Client initiates, server responds
Both client and server can initiate communication
Connection
Typically short-lived (though can be persistent)
Long-lived, persistent connection
Latency
Higher due to request/response overhead
Lower due to persistent connection and reduced overhead
Use Cases
REST APIs, data fetching, general HTTP interaction
Real-time applications, chat, live updates, gaming

What is the difference between Spring WebClient and WebTestClient?
WebTestClient is an HTTP client designed for testing server applications. It wraps Spring's WebClient and uses it to perform requests but exposes a testing facade for verifying responses. WebTestClient can be used to perform end-to-end HTTP tests.
